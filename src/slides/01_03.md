# Project Files

Before we get started, we'll need some files we can work with.

I prepared a project with some files you can use to follow along.

Normally, I like to use CodeSpaces to work on my projects, but the problem is that I need to use the nightly version of Visual Studio Code and some cutting edge extensions that are experimental.

So, I'm going to clone this repository to my hard drive.

This is an advanced course, so I'm assuming you understand how to work with github, the terminal and repos. If not, please take a look at one of my other courses. Learning Git and GitHub.

https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/github-practical-copilot-4412871.git

The repo will have different branches for how the project looked as I progressed through the project.

However, one of the things about using GitHub copilot is that it doesn't always give you consistent solutions for problems. So I just want to let you know that when you try some of the prompts I'm using chances are that it's going to give you code that looks different.

As long as it works, it's fine. Part of working with copilot means understanding that there's a creative element to the Model.
